    description : `We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

    Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
    Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
    Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps

    You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when youre signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

    To help explain things as clearly as possible, we've added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.`,
