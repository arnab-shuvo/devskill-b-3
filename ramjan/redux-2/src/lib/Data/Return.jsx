    description: `People are often hesitant to buy online, which can lead to low conversion rates and sales. Return and refund policies for ecommerce stores have been proven to increase the number of people who end up making a purchase once they're on your website.

    Perhaps more importantly, however, having a Return and Refund Policy in place can help reduce your expenses when it comes to return deliveries. For instance, consider the fact that in the United States alone, Statista's most up-to-date statistics show that return deliveries cost businesses $550 Billion between 2016 and 2020.
    
    That's a 75.2% increase over five years ago.
    
    Of course, customers may be unhappy with their order for many reasons. It might arrive damaged, it was the wrong size or it didn't meet all their expectations. They may request a refund or a replacement.
    
    These requests can be overwhelming without a system to handle them. Think of all the time necessary to handle customer service emails and the money your company may have to spend to replace the returned product. Now think about those expenses just after Black Friday or Christmas!
    
    Thankfully, the solution is relatively simple. You can make returns and exchanges less of a problem by writing and posting a solid Return and Refund Policy for your website. Moreover, you can help increase customer loyalty and potentially generate new revenue by doing so.
    Standard Ecommerce Return Rates
    
    There is no single return rate for eCommerce that you should accept as typical. Return rates for eCommerce vary greatly by product category. Indeed, no two industries are the same.
    
    With that said, some statistics show average return rates for certain product categories, such as the following:
    
        Clothing and shoes: 30 to 40%
        Food: 7%
        Furniture: 5%
        Home electronics: 10%
        Average of all eCommerce returns: 15-30%
    
    Evidence shows that eCommerce stores with lower volumes are inclined to have lower returns than those with greater volume. This may be a result of the fact that more established eCommerce businesses tend to have more flexible Return and Refund Policies, or because consumers feel less guilty about returning products to corporations than they do to small-scale online stores.
    
    Regardless of the size of your operations, it can be hard to decide the right approach for your business with regard to your Return and Refund Policy.
    
    Many eCommerce companies can't afford to offer free returns like big online retailers. However, that doesn't mean you can't provide your customers with a policy they'll appreciate.
    Are Return and Refund Policies Legally Required?
    
    The United States doesn't have a federal law which governs returns or refunds. No state laws require one either, although some states do have regulations about where you must place your policy if you choose to write one.
    
    However, even without laws requiring one, there are still good reasons to put a Return and Refund Policy in place.
    
    For example, your customers expect to be informed about your policies and to know that you'll adhere to terms that have become commonplace within the eCommerce industry.
